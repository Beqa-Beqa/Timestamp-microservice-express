# Timestamp-microservice-express
<br/>

## My first express project from one of the FCC challenges

[Challenge URL](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/back-end-development-and-apis-projects/timestamp-microservice)


## Set up on your local machine

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Beqa-Beqa/Timestamp-microservice-express.git   #This will clone the repository

npm install #Install all neccessary dependencies and you are all set

```

Make a GET request with UTC or UNIX date format on "localhost.../api/<your-date>/" after initializing the project on your local machine.
It will send you back json file with both UTC and UNIX times in it.
